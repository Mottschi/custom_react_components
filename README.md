# Custom React Hooks

This repository was created to collect custom react hooks created for various projects, to be able to reuse them later on. It is not meant as a standalone project by itself.

As Next.js does not allow for access to certain elements on the initial render, adapting hooks for use with Next.js in the folder nextHooks.
